The Nautilus production support team and security team had a meeting last month in which they decided to use local yum repositories for maintaing packages needed for their servers. For now they have decided to configure a local yum repo on Nautilus Backup Server. This is one of the pending items from last month, so please configure a local yum repository on Nautilus Backup Server as per details given below.


a. We have some packages already present at location /packages/downloaded_rpms/ on Nautilus Backup Server.

b. Create a yum repo named localyum and make sure to set Repository ID to localyum. Configure it to use package's location /packages/downloaded_rpms/.

c. Install package samba from this newly created repo.


Solution 

  - First comfirm that you can not install samba package 
    - sudo yum install samba  # See no enabled repos error 
  - cd /packages/downloaded_rpms/
  - sudo vi /etc/yum.repos.d/localyum.repo # create a repo file
        [localyum]
        name=localyum
        baseurl=file:///packages/downloaded_rpms/
        enabled=1
        gpgcheck=0
  - sudo yum-config-manager --enable localyum
  - sudo yum instal samba
