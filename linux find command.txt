During a routine security audit, the team identified an issue on the Nautilus App Server. Some malicious content was identified within the website code. After digging into the issue they found that there might be more infected files. Before doing a cleanup they would like to find all similar files and copy them to a safe location for further investigation. Accomplish the task as per the following requirements:


a. On App Server 1 at location /var/www/html/ecommerce find out all files (not directories) having .js extension.

b. Copy all those files along with their parent directory structure to location /ecommerce on same server.

c. Please make sure not to copy the entire /var/www/html/ecommerce directory content.

Solution:
- ssh to the app server 
- go to directory /var/www/html/ecommerce
- sudo find . -type f -name '*.js' -exec cp --parents {} /ecommerce/ \;

Explanantion of command
Commands            Explanantion
sudo          --    this assume root privelegde 
find          --    this is the command we use to find things in unix. it comes pre-installed on most unix-like distribution
.             --    this tells find command to find in current directory (in our case /var/www/html/ecommerce)
-type f       --    here we tell find command we want to find type of files (if you looking for directory you would have -type d)
-name '*.js'  --    the name of the file we want. * infornt of .js is a widecat saying any name that ends with .js
-exec cp      --    Tells you to execute the 'cp' command to copy files from source to destination directory.
--parents     --    we want this copy to include the parent directory of this file starting from our current directory
{}            --    is automatically replaced with the file name of the files found by 'find' command.
/ecommerce/   --    Target directory to save the matching files.
\;            --    Indicates it that the commands to be executed are now complete, and to carry out the command again on the next match.
