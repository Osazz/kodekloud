To secure our Nautilus infrastructure in Stratos Datacenter we have decided to install and configure firewalld on all app servers. We have Apache and Nginx services running on these apps. Nginx is running as a reverse proxy server for Apache. We might have more robust firewall settings in the future, but for now we have decided to go with the given requirements listed below:


a. Allow all incoming connections on Nginx port.

b. Allow incoming connections from LB host only on Apache port and block for all others.

c. All rules must be permanent.

d. Zone should be public.

e. If Apache or Nginx services aren't running already, please make sure to start them.


Solution:

-- Check is apache and nginx services is running 
          -- sudo service httpd status # check apache is running
          -- sudo service nginx status # check Nginx is running
                  --- If any is not running start it with 
                        sudo service <service name> start
                        

-- install firewalld
    sudo yum install firewalld -y 
    sudo systemctl start firewalld # start the service 
    sudo systemctl enable firewalld # enable it to run on reboot
    sudo firewall-cmd --get-default-zone # Check default zone Must be public 
            --- if not public change zone using 
                -- sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public 
                
                
--- Check which port nginx is listening on 
          -- cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf | grep listen
                        listen       8093 default_server       
                        
---  Allow incoming connection to Nginx
    sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=8093/tcp
    sudo firewall-cmd --reload
    sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-ports
---- check Apache port 
    cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf | grep Listen
          # Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or
          # Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to 
          #Listen 12.34.56.78:80
          Listen 6300
--- Allow incoming connection from LB on Apache  
       sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-rich-rule='rule family=ipv4 source address=172.16.238.14 port port=6300 protocol=tcp accept'  # 6300 is              apache port and 172.16.238.14  is LB IP
        
        sudo firewall-cmd --reload
        sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all
        
        
        
For other 2 servers, I put the script in a bash file 
-- vi bash.sh create bash script 
        #!/bin/bash
        sudo service httpd status # check apache is running
        sudo service nginx status # check Nginx is running
        sudo yum install firewalld -y 
        sudo systemctl start firewalld # start the service 
        sudo systemctl enable firewalld # enable it to run on reboot
        sudo firewall-cmd --get-default-zone # Check default zone Must be public 
        cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf | grep listen
        sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=8093/tcp
        sudo firewall-cmd --reload
        sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-ports
        cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf | grep Listen
        sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-rich-rule='rule family=ipv4 source address=172.16.238.14 port port=6300 protocol=tcp accept'         
        sudo firewall-cmd --reload
        sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all
-- chmod +x bash.sh 
-- sudo -u # use user password
