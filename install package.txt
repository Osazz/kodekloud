As per new application requirements shared by the Nautilus project development team, serveral new packages need to be 
installed on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter. Most of them are completed except for telnet.


Therefore, install the telnet package on all app-servers.


Solution: 

- rpm -qa | grep telnet # check if telnet has been installed 
- sudo yum install -y telnet  # Install telnet if it dosnt exist when you check above 
- rpm -qa | grep telnet # Confirm it has been installed
