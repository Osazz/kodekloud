On our Storage server in Stratos Datacenter we are having some issues where nfsuser user is holding hundred of processes, 
which is degrading the performance of the server. Therefore, we have a requirement to limit its maximum processes. 
Please set its maximum process limits as below:

a. soft limit = 77

b. hard_limit = 92

Solution


 - sudo vi /etc/security/limits.conf
  # add the below lines at the end of the file 
      # Setting max and min value for nfsuser process 
      nfsuser        soft    nproc           77
      nfsuser        hard    nproc           92
